# quetzal_germany
This open source project is a macroscopic transport model for the region of Germany. It supports research aimed at designing an integrated, renewable energy system with mobility behaviour insights.

It uses the quetzal transport modelling framework: https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal

The method is oriented towards classical four-step transport modelling. Focus lies on mode choice by using a purpose-segmented nested logit model.

## Structure

![Structure of quetzal_germany](input/quetzal_germany_structure_chart.pdf "Structure of quetzal_germany")

The directory structure is straight-forward:
> quetzal_germany/</br>
> -- input/</br>
> -- input_static/</br>
> -- model/</br>
> -- output/</br>

While input and output data as well as (temporary) model files are stored in seperate folders, Jupyter Notebooks contain all data management and modelling. Briefly, they are structured as follows (`X` as wildcard):
* ``prep1X``: Generation of transport demand zones and all transport networks in high resolution
* ``prep2X``: Aggregation of PT network graph and connection to transport demand sources and sinks. You can either cluster stops and connect the clusters to zone centroids or connect centroids to certain stops first and then aggregate the rest
* ``prep3X``: Calculation of shortest paths and enrichment with performance attributes for PT and cars, respectively
* ``calX``: Generation of calibration dataset and estimation of parameters (only applicable with access to calibration data (see below))
* ``model2X``: Generation of OD matrix (steps trip generation and distribution together)
* ``model3X``: Mode choice
* ``model4X``: Route assignment
* ``valX``: Validation of the model results

## Usage

### Installation

1. Create a virtual environment for quetzal models: Clone the quetzal package into a local folder and create a virtual environment as described here *[1]*: https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal
2. Activate your quetzal environment, if not done yet
3. Clone this repository into a local folder: In your terminal, navigate to the position where you want to store the code. Type `git clone <this repo's URL>`. Navigate into the folder `quetzal_germany`.
4. Download static input files from Zenodo *[2]* into a folder named `input_static/` within the `quetzal_germany` repository: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4740207.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4740207)
5. Open the local project in Jupyter Notebook (in your terminal type `jupyter notebook`) and start running the notebooks

*[1]*: If you face problems importing geopandas, consider uninstalling package `rtree` and reinstalling a version up to 0.9.3 (`conda install -c conda-forge rtree=0.9.3`)
*[2]*: If you wonder why these files are not hosted in this very repository: Large input data files require different handling and some of them also require a license different to this repo's licensing.

### First model run

You can run the whole model by executing all notebooks in the order stated under Structure. However, the repository comes with transport networks but without level-of-service (LoS) attributes assigned to origin-destination (OD) relations. This is because LoS attribution is strongly assumption-driven and the LoS shortest path table is too large to be hosted online efficiently. Thus, you only need to create LoS tables for road and PT connections by running all `prep3X` notebooks and adjusting the assumptions made, if needed. However, adjustments to LoS attributes must be consistent with assumptions made for calibration data (`calX` notebooks).

Your StepModel object (always abbreviated with `sm`) is where the magic happens. It saves all tables as attributes and provides all transport modelling specific functions from the quetzal library. Quetzal provides wrapper function for classic steps in aggregated transport modelling (trip generation, assignment, etc.), which execute a set of more specific functions. Due to a higher degree of customisation, this model mostly uses quetzal's specific functions.

After creating LoS tables you are able to run the mode choice model. If you don't have access to travel demand data (see below), you can only run `model3X` - mode choice. This will output mode choice probabilities, which you can then visualise using the `valX` notebooks.

### Example for custom region

Notebook `prep10` creates the four step model (`sm`) with a zones table that you specify. By default, it contains all NUTS3 zones of Germany, but you can limit it to the desired region or refine it with higher resolution data.

Notebooks `prep11` to `prep14` create road and PT networks from openstreetmap and German-wide GTFS feeds, respectively. They will be saved in `sm.road_links`/`sm.road_nodes` and `sm.links`/`sm.nodes`, respectively. Additionally, a list `sm.pt_route_types` is created. Make sure you uncomment the cell where you spatially restrict the network graph, if you want a smaller region. Notebook `prep15` creates distances from all population points in the latest census to your PT stops. Make sure to spatially restrict this one too.

The rest works straight-forward with the notebooks' comments and should work for every self-defined region. At the end of each notebook in the 'save' cell(s) you find all DataFrames (as `sm`'s attributes) that will be relevant in later steps. One additional attribute is always present: `sm.epsg` which defines the coordinate reference system.

### Data accessibility

This repository together with externally hosted data packages contains all openly licensed data sources which are necessary for mode choice modelling in Germany.

Though, for estimating calibration parameters (beyond the estimation results given in `input/`) and assignment of absolute traffic flows, there are additional data sources needed:
* Calibration uses a large national survey of mobility behaviour "[Mobilit√§t in Deutschland 2017](http://www.mobilitaet-in-deutschland.de/) B2" (MiD2017)
* Assignment uses modified origin destination matrices from the underlying model of the German federal governments transport study "[Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2030](https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/G/BVWP/bundesverkehrswegeplan-2030-inhalte-herunterladen.html)"

You can apply for access to both data sets using the national [Clearing House Transport order form](https://daten.clearingstelle-verkehr.de/order-form.html)

## Next steps:

* Calculation of mode choice elasticities
* Scenario modelling
* Linkage to an energy system model
